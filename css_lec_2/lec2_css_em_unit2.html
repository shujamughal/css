<!--The "em" unit is inherently tied to the font-size property,
as it represents a relative measurement based on the font size of the element
or its parent. However, it's not limited to only being used in the context
of the font-size property. While it is commonly associated with font sizes,
you can use the "em" unit for other properties as well,
and it will be relative to the font size.-->
